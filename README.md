# NextJS URL shortener

This is a URL shortener application using Next.js framework.

## Configure default redirect URL

To configure the default redirect URL, set the `DEFAULT_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable.

## Add URLs

Edit `/app/urls.ts` and add your short URLs to the `urls` map.

It can be as easy as editing the file directly on GitHub.

Don't forget to clone the project as a `private` if you don't want the URLs to be know.
